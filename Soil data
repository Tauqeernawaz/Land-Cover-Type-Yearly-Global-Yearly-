   - The dataset is available in **vector format** (Shapefile, GeoJSON, etc.).

### 2. **Data Preprocessing in ArcGIS**:
   - The **vector data** was imported into **ArcGIS** for further processing.
   - The dataset was **reprojected** to ensure it is compatible with the **study area** coordinate system.
   - Necessary pre-processing steps were performed, such as **clipping** the data to the region of interest (ROI) and **cleaning** any erroneous data.

### 3. **Reprojection**:
   - The original data was in a different **coordinate reference system** and was reprojected to match the spatial reference of the study area.
   
### 4. **Data Compatibility**:
   - After preprocessing, the data was formatted for use in analysis and visualizations.

## Data Processing:
- **Reprojection**: The vector data was reprojected to match the spatial reference of the study area.
- **Clipping**: The data was clipped to the boundaries of the study area for more specific analysis.
- **Pre-processing**: Additional steps, such as **filtering** and **data cleaning**, were applied to ensure compatibility and accuracy for analysis.

## Geographical Coverage:
- The data covers the **[specific geographical area or region]**, which corresponds to the **study area** for this research.
- **Latitude**: [Insert latitude range]
- **Longitude**: [Insert longitude range]

## Data Format:
- The soil data is available in **vector format** (e.g., **Shapefiles**, **GeoJSON**).
- After processing, the data is ready for use in **ArcGIS** and other GIS platforms.

## How to Use:
1. **Download the Data**: The **processed soil data** (in **Shapefile** or **GeoTIFF** format) can be downloaded from this repository.
2. **Run Analysis**: Use **ArcGIS** or any other GIS software to open and analyze the soil data.
   - You can perform **spatial analysis**, **classification**, or **mapping** to better understand soil properties and their relationship to land use in your study area.
3. **Visualize**: After processing, the data can be visualized using **ArcGIS** or **QGIS** to create **soil maps** and interpret soil properties.
# Windbreaks Calculation using Climatic Erosivity, Surface Roughness, and Soil Erodibility

This repository contains a script for calculating **Windbreaks** using key environmental factors: **Climatic Erosivity Factor (Fq)**, **Surface Roughness (D)**, and **Soil Erodibility (K)**, derived from precipitation, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), and slope data. The calculations are based on environmental proxies that represent these factors, processed using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**.

The **Windbreaks** calculation integrates these factors to model erosion and land degradation processes, which are important for environmental monitoring and land management.

## Datasets:
1. **Precipitation Data (IMERG)**:
   - **Source**: [NASA GPM IMERG](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_GPM_L3_IMERG_V06)
   - The **precipitation data** for the year 2019 was used to estimate **Climatic Erosivity Factor (Fq)**.

2. **Digital Elevation Model (SRTM)**:
   - **Source**: [USGS SRTM DEM](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_SRTMGL1_003)
   - The **SRTM DEM** was used to calculate **surface roughness (D)** and **slope** (used as a proxy for **soil erodibility (K)**).

## Methodology:
1. **Climatic Erosivity Factor (Fq)**: 
   - This factor uses **precipitation** as a proxy for climatic erosivity, which plays a key role in soil erosion caused by rainfall.

2. **Surface Roughness (D)**: 
   - This factor represents the roughness of the surface. It is calculated by taking the **absolute difference** between the **DEM** and a **smoothed version of the DEM** (using focal mean). 

3. **Soil Erodibility (K)**: 
   - This factor is represented by **slope** (calculated from **DEM**). Steeper slopes typically have higher soil erosion potential.

4. **Windbreaks Calculation**: 
   - The final **Windbreaks** factor is derived by multiplying **Fq (Climatic Erosivity Factor)**, **D (Surface Roughness)**, and **K (Soil Erodibility)** to estimate areas most susceptible to erosion and degradation.

## Data Processing in Google Earth Engine:
The following steps were executed in **Google Earth Engine** to process and analyze the data:
1. **Precipitation Data**: Downloaded and filtered precipitation data for the year 2019 from the **NASA IMERG dataset**.
2. **DEM Data**: Downloaded **SRTM DEM** data and used it to calculate surface roughness and slope.
3. **Fq, D, and K Calculation**: The **Climatic Erosivity Factor (Fq)** was derived from precipitation, **Surface Roughness (D)** from DEM difference, and **Soil Erodibility (K)** from slope.
4. **Windbreaks**: The product of the three factors (**Fq**, **D**, and **K**) was calculated to model **windbreaks**.

## Geographical Coverage:
- **Region of Interest (ROI)**: The data is clipped to a **Region of Interest (ROI)**, which can be defined as a specific geographical area for the study.
- **Latitude**: [Insert latitude range of ROI]
- **Longitude**: [Insert longitude range of ROI]

## Data Format:
- The output of the calculations for **Fq**, **D**, and **K** are provided in **GeoTIFF** format.
- The **Windbreaks** output is also provided in **GeoTIFF** format for further analysis in GIS software such as **QGIS** or **ArcGIS**.
